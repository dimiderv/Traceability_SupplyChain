# Traceability application network

In this supply chain network there will be 3 participating organizations:
  * Farmers (Org1)
  * Retailers (Org2)
  * Supermarket-Consumers(Org3)

(Insert Network Architecture Image)

  To avoid conflicts we create 2 private collections between transacting parties (Org1-Org2, Org2-Org3).
Any transactions details (prices etc) should remain private and only transacting organizations should have access.
